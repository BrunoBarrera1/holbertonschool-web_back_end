This project covers ES6 data manipulation concepts including:

- Array methods: map, filter, reduce
- Typed arrays
- Set, Map, and WeakMap data structures

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to explain:

- How to use map, filter and reduce on arrays

- The Set, Map, and Weak link data structures

## Requirements

- All files will be interpreted/compiled on Ubuntu 20.04 LTS using node 20.x.x and npm 9.x.x
- All files should end with a new line
- Code should use the `.js` extension
- Code will be tested using Jest: `npm run test`
- Code will be verified against lint using ESLint
- Code needs to pass all tests and lint: `npm run full-test`
- All functions must be exported

## Setup

1. Install dependencies: `npm install`
2. Run tests: `npm run test`
3. Run full test suite: `npm run full-test`
