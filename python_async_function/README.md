# Python - Async

This project focuses on learning asynchronous programming in Python using `asyncio`, `async`, and `await` syntax.

## Learning Objectives

- `async` and `await` syntax
- How to execute an async program with `asyncio`
- How to run concurrent coroutines
- How to create `asyncio` tasks
- How to use the `random` module

## Files

- `0-basic_async_syntax.py`: Basic async coroutine that waits for a random delay
- `1-concurrent_coroutines.py`: Execute multiple coroutines concurrently
- `2-measure_runtime.py`: Measure execution time of async operations
- `3-tasks.py`: Create asyncio tasks
- `4-tasks.py`: Execute multiple tasks concurrently

## Requirements

- All files should be executable
- All files must start with `#!/usr/bin/env python3`
- Code should follow pycodestyle (version 2.5.x)
- All functions and coroutines must be type-annotated
- All modules and functions should have documentation
